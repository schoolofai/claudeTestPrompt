# Product Requirements Document: User Authentication System

## Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a secure user authentication system for our web application. The system will provide user registration, login/logout, password management, and basic profile functionality while maintaining high security standards and excellent user experience.

## Goals
1. **Enable user accounts** - Allow users to create and manage personal accounts
2. **Secure authentication** - Implement industry-standard security practices
3. **Persistent sessions** - Users remain logged in across browser sessions
4. **Self-service password management** - Users can reset passwords independently
5. **Scalable foundation** - Support for future features like user roles and permissions

## User Stories

### Registration Flow
- **As a new user**, I want to create an account with my email and password so that I can access personalized features
- **As a new user**, I want to receive an email verification so that I can confirm my account is secure
- **As a new user**, I want clear feedback if my chosen password doesn't meet security requirements

### Login/Logout Flow
- **As a registered user**, I want to login with my email and password so that I can access my account
- **As a logged-in user**, I want to stay logged in when I close and reopen my browser
- **As a logged-in user**, I want to securely logout when I'm finished using the application

### Password Management
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account
- **As a user**, I want to change my password while logged in so that I can maintain account security

### Profile Management
- **As a logged-in user**, I want to view and update my profile information so that I can keep my account current
- **As a logged-in user**, I want to delete my account if I no longer want to use the service

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Registration
1.1. System must collect email address and password for new accounts
1.2. System must validate email format and domain existence
1.3. System must enforce password requirements: minimum 8 characters, containing letters and numbers
1.4. System must check for existing accounts with the same email address
1.5. System must send email verification to new users
1.6. System must prevent login until email is verified
1.7. System must store user data securely with hashed passwords

### 2. Email Verification
2.1. System must generate secure, time-limited verification tokens
2.2. System must send verification emails with clickable links
2.3. System must mark accounts as verified when valid tokens are used
2.4. System must allow resending verification emails
2.5. Verification tokens must expire after 24 hours

### 3. User Login
3.1. System must authenticate users with email and password
3.2. System must generate secure session tokens (JWT) upon successful login
3.3. System must return authentication status and user information
3.4. System must handle invalid credentials gracefully
3.5. System must implement rate limiting for login attempts

### 4. Session Management
4.1. System must maintain user sessions for 24 hours by default
4.2. System must allow users to extend sessions through activity
4.3. System must provide secure logout functionality
4.4. System must validate session tokens on protected routes
4.5. System must handle expired sessions gracefully

### 5. Password Reset
5.1. System must allow password reset via email address
5.2. System must generate secure, time-limited reset tokens
5.3. System must send password reset emails with secure links
5.4. System must allow setting new passwords with valid reset tokens
5.5. Reset tokens must expire after 1 hour
5.6. System must invalidate all existing sessions after password reset

### 6. User Profile Management
6.1. System must allow users to view their profile information
6.2. System must allow users to update their email address (with re-verification)
6.3. System must allow users to change their password (with current password verification)
6.4. System must provide account deletion functionality
6.5. System must handle profile updates with proper validation

### 7. Security Requirements
7.1. All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
7.2. Session tokens must be signed JWT tokens with secure algorithms
7.3. All authentication endpoints must use HTTPS
7.4. System must implement CSRF protection
7.5. System must sanitize all user inputs
7.6. System must log authentication events for security monitoring

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Social media login integration (OAuth)
- Two-factor authentication (future consideration)
- User roles and permissions system
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Advanced profile fields beyond email
- User avatar/photo upload
- API key management for users

## Technical Considerations
- **Database**: Add users table with proper indexes
- **Security**: Use bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for sessions
- **Email**: Integrate with email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- **Frontend**: Update UI to include auth forms and protected routes
- **API**: Design RESTful endpoints for all auth operations
- **Middleware**: Create authentication middleware for route protection
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error responses
- **Validation**: Add input validation for all user data

## Success Metrics
1. **Registration Success Rate**: >95% of users complete registration process
2. **Email Verification Rate**: >80% of users verify their email within 24 hours
3. **Login Success Rate**: >98% for valid credentials
4. **Session Duration**: Average session length >20 minutes
5. **Password Reset Usage**: <5% of users need password reset per month
6. **Security Incidents**: Zero authentication-related security breaches
7. **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating for authentication experience

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement "Remember Me" functionality for extended sessions?
2. What level of password complexity should we enforce?
3. Should we allow users to change their email without re-verification?
4. Do we need admin functionality to manage user accounts?
5. How should we handle suspicious login attempts?
6. Should we implement email notifications for account security events?
