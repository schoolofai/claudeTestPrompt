# User Authentication System

## Overview
Implement a secure user authentication system for our web application that allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles safely.

## Problem Statement
Currently, our application doesn't have user accounts, which means:
- Users can't save their preferences or data
- We can't provide personalized experiences
- There's no way to secure sensitive features
- User engagement is limited without persistence

## Desired Outcome
A complete authentication system that enables:
- Secure user registration with email verification
- Safe login/logout functionality
- Password reset capabilities
- Basic user profile management
- Protection of authenticated routes

## Success Criteria
- Users can create accounts and verify their email
- Login session persists for 24 hours unless explicitly logged out
- Password reset flow works via email
- No security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
- 95% of users successfully complete registration process

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing Node.js/Express backend
- Should use industry-standard security practices
- Need to integrate with current database schema
- Should support both web and future mobile clients

## Target Users
- **Primary**: End users of the web application
- **Secondary**: Administrators who need user management capabilities

This system should be ready for production use with proper security, error handling, and user experience considerations.
