# [Feature/Application Name] - Design Brief

## Problem Statement
<!-- 
Clearly articulate the problem you're solving. This section should answer:
- What is the current situation/pain point?
- Who is affected by this problem?
- What are the consequences of not solving it?
- What constraints exist (technical, business, regulatory)?

Example: "The system currently lacks ability to X, causing Y impact on Z users..."
-->

[Describe the specific problem, current limitations, and why a solution is needed]

## Solution Overview
<!--
High-level description of your proposed solution. Keep it concise but complete:
- What is the core approach?
- How does it solve the problem?
- What are the main components?
- What's the expected outcome?

This should be understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
-->

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
<!--
Describe the main components and their responsibilities:

-->

```
[Component Diagram or Tree Structure]
├── Component A/     # [Responsibility]

├── Component B/     # [Responsibility]
└── Component C/     # [Responsibility]
```

### Data Flow
<!--
Show how data moves through the system. Consider using:
- Sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- Simple flow descriptions for straightforward processes
- State diagrams for stateful components
-->

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as [Actor/System A]
    participant B as [Component B]
    participant C as [Data Store C]
    
    A->>B: [Action/Request]
    B->>C: [Data Operation]
    C->>B: [Response]
    B->>A: [Result]
```

### Technology Stack
<!--
List the technologies, frameworks, and tools:
- Programming languages and frameworks
- Databases and storage solutions

-->

- **Runtime**: [e.g., Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+]
- **Framework**: [e.g., FastAPI, Express]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- **External Services**: [e.g., AWS S3, SendGrid]
- **Key Libraries**: [e.g., Pydantic, React Query]

## Implementation Approach

### Development Phases
<!--
Break down the implementation into manageable phases/milestones:
- What can be delivered incrementally?
- What are the dependencies between phases?
- What constitutes an MVP vs full feature?
-->

#### Phase 1: [Foundation/MVP]
- [ ] [Deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Core functionality]

#### Phase 2: [Enhancement]
- [ ] [Additional feature 1]
- [ ] [Performance optimization]
- [ ] [Extended functionality]

#### Phase 3: [Polish/Scale]
- [ ] [Advanced features]
- [ ] [Monitoring/observability]
- [ ] [Documentation completion]

### API/Interface Design
<!--
Define the main interfaces (if applicable):
- REST endpoints
- GraphQL schema
- CLI commands
- SDK methods
-->

```[language]
# Example API endpoint
POST /api/v1/[resource]
{
  "field1": "value",
  "field2": 123
}

# Example CLI command
app [command] [resource] --option value
```
