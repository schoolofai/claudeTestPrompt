# Tasks Directory

This directory contains feature development workspaces. Each feature gets its own subdirectory with:

- High-level brief (e.g., `feature-brief.md`)
- Product Requirements Document (e.g., `prd-feature-name.md`)
- Task list (e.g., `tasks-prd-feature-name.md`)
- Implementation files
- Generated documentation

## Example Structure

```
tasks/
├── user-authentication/
│   ├── auth-brief.md
│   ├── prd-user-auth.md
│   ├── tasks-prd-user-auth.md
│   └── README.md
└── api-integration/
    ├── integration-brief.md
    ├── prd-api-integration.md
    ├── tasks-prd-api-integration.md
    └── README.md
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new directory for your feature: `mkdir tasks/my-feature`
2. Write a high-level brief: `touch tasks/my-feature/brief.md`
3. Use Claude Code commands to generate PRD and tasks
4. Start implementation following the TDD workflow
